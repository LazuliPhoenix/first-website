            Part 1, I Told Sunset About You, follows the relationship of Teh and Oh-aew, schoolboys living in Phuket who used to be childhood best friends but had a falling out and have not spoken for several years. Now in their final year of school, they meet again at a Chinese-language tutorial school as they prepare for university admissions. Starting out as rivals, they eventually make up and begin rebuilding their relationship as Teh helps tutor Oh-aew for their upcoming Chinese exam. They grow closer, forming a new bond that begins to extend beyond friendship but also tests their relationship as Teh struggles to understand and deal with his feelings.

            Teh and Oh-aew are supported by their friends and family, but also have to deal with their own conflicting feelings for them. Teh is from a Chinese Thai family and lives with his mother and elder brother Hoon, and has a close female friend, Tarn. Oh-aew lives with his parents, who own an island resort, and is close friends with Bas, who recently joined his and Teh's mutual group of friends Mod, Kai and Phillip.

            "The country's leading all-boys school, Suppalo, is strictly governed. Rumour has it that a curse will punish students who act out, a curse that grows stronger as the solar eclipse nears. 

            But where there are rules, there will naturally be those who want to break them. A group of students calling themselves “The World Remembers” unite to challenge the school's authority and demand their rights. Head student prefect Akk and his cohorts are tasked with dissuading the rebel group. Then Ayan, a mysterious new student, arrives. Akk is suspicious of Ayan, this boy whose behaviour is so odd and who regularly challenges the school's norms. 
            
            Ayan has enrolled in hopes of discovering the person who pushed his uncle Dika to suicide. His only evidence leading him to Suppalo School is in his uncle's old notebook. Ayan's method of dealing with Akk's scrutiny is to toy with him."

            "Han Geu Roo is a 20-year-old Autistic. He works for his father’s business “Move To Heaven,” a company that specializes in crime scene cleanup, where they also collect and arrange items left by deceased people, and deliver them to the bereaved family.

            When Geu Roo's father dies, Geu Roo's guardianship passes to his uncle, ex-convict Cho Sang Gu, who is a martial arts fighter in underground matches. Per the father's will, Sang Gu must care for and work with Geu Roo in “Move To Heaven” for three months to gain full guardianship and claim the inheritance.
